```

#### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
- **Compound Components**: For complex UI patterns
- **Render Props**: For shared logic
- **Custom Hooks**: For business logic extraction

#### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Server State (TanStack Query)
- Products data
- User profile
- Order history
- Cart synchronization

// Client State (Zustand)
- Cart items (with optimistic updates)
- UI preferences (theme, filters)
- Form state (checkout)
- Navigation state
```

## API Integration Plan

### Backend Endpoints Mapping

#### Authentication
```typescript
POST /auth/register → Register new user
POST /auth/jwt/login → User login (form-encoded)
POST /auth/jwt/logout → User logout
GET /auth/users/me → Get current user profile
PATCH /auth/users/me → Update user profile
```

#### Products
```typescript
GET /products → Product listing with pagination/filters
GET /products/{id} → Product details
GET /products/search → Product search functionality
```

#### Cart Management
```typescript
GET /cart → Get current cart
POST /cart/items → Add item to cart
PUT /cart/items/{id} → Update item quantity
DELETE /cart/items/{id} → Remove item from cart
DELETE /cart → Clear entire cart
POST /cart/validate → Validate cart before checkout
POST /cart/merge → Merge session cart (on login)
```

#### Orders
```typescript
POST /orders → Create new order
GET /orders → Order history
GET /orders/{id} → Order details
```

### API Client Architecture

#### Base Configuration
```typescript
// lib/api/client.ts
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'

export const apiClient = {
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  credentials: 'include', // For httpOnly cookies
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }
}
```

#### Authentication Strategy
```typescript
// Option 1: httpOnly Cookies (Preferred)
- Backend sets secure, httpOnly JWT cookie
- Frontend sends credentials: 'include'
- CORS configuration allows credentials

// Option 2: localStorage Fallback
- Store JWT in localStorage
- Add Authorization header to requests
- Handle token refresh logic
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// Global error interceptor
- Network errors → Retry with exponential backoff
- 401 Unauthorized → Redirect to login
- 403 Forbidden → Show access denied
- 422 Validation → Show field-specific errors
- 500 Server Error → Show generic error toast
```
