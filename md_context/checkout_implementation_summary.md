# Checkout Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete checkout functionality has been implemented for the PyShop e-commerce application, including both backend API and frontend UI components.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Models (`app/models/order.py`)
- **Order Model**: Complete order tracking with all details
  - UUID primary key, unique order number
  - Order and payment status enums
  - Financial fields (subtotal, tax, shipping, total)
  - Complete shipping address information
  - Timestamps for all order events
  - Foreign key to user

- **OrderItem Model**: Product snapshot at time of purchase
  - Links to order and product
  - Stores product name, price at time of order
  - Quantity and calculated totals

### 2. Business Logic (`app/services/checkout_service.py`)
- Cart validation before checkout
- Order number generation (format: `ORD-YYYYMMDD-RANDOM`)
- Order creation from active cart
- Cart conversion (marks cart as "converted")
- Order management (get, list, update status, cancel)
- Product detail snapshotting for historical accuracy

### 3. API Endpoints (`app/routers/orders.py`)
- `POST /orders/checkout` - Create order from cart
- `GET /orders` - List user's orders (paginated)
- `GET /orders/{order_id}` - Get order details
- `GET /orders/number/{order_number}` - Get by order number
- `POST /orders/{order_id}/cancel` - Cancel order

### 4. Database Migration
- File: `alembic/versions/e6f7g8h9i0j1_add_order_and_orderitem_tables.py`
- Creates `order` and `order_item` tables
- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints

### 5. Tests (`tests/test_checkout.py`)
- Checkout with multiple items
- Empty cart validation
- Order listing
- Order retrieval by ID
- Order cancellation
- Authorization checks

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. TypeScript Types (`frontend/src/types/order.ts`)
- OrderStatus enum
- PaymentStatus enum
- ShippingAddress interface
- CheckoutRequest interface
- OrderRead interface
- OrderListItem interface
- OrderItemRead interface

### 2. API Client (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)
- `orderApi.checkout()` - Submit checkout
- `orderApi.getOrders()` - List orders
- `orderApi.getOrder()` - Get single order
- `orderApi.getOrderByNumber()` - Get by order number
- `orderApi.cancelOrder()` - Cancel order

### 3. Pages

#### Products Page (`frontend/src/app/products/page.tsx`)
- **Updated**: Added "View Cart" button next to cart summary
- Shows when cart has items
- Redirects to `/cart` page

#### Cart Page (`frontend/src/app/cart/page.tsx`)
- **Existing**: Already has "Proceed to Checkout" button
- Displays cart items with quantity controls

- Redirects to `/checkout`

#### Checkout Page (`frontend/src/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- **New**: Complete checkout form
- Shipping information form (all fields)

- Redirects to order detail on success

#### Order Detail Page (`frontend/src/app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **New**: Complete order details
- Order items list
- Shipping information display
- Order summary
- Order timeline with timestamps
- Cancel order button (for pending/confirmed)
- Status badges with colors
- Payment status display

#### Orders List Page (`frontend/src/app/orders/page.tsx`)
- **New**: List of all user orders
- Order cards with summary info
- Status and payment badges
- Click to view details
- Empty state with call-to-action

### 4. UI Components
- **Textarea**: Created new component for order notes

## User Flow
